    `npm install` 
    
3.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set any required environment variables.
    
4.  **Run the App:** Start the development server by running:
    
    `npm start` 
    
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    

## Deployment

You can deploy the app online using platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Here's a general guide for deploying using Vercel:

3.  **Build the App:** Before deploying, build the production version of the app:
    
    `npm run build` 
    
4.  **Deploy to Vercel:** Run the following command and follow the prompts:
    
    `vercel` 
    
    Vercel will guide you through the deployment process.
